# README
This is the repository containing the proposed solution of the team _BAB-thebuilders_ to the problem of road segmentation that was proposed in the scope in the Machine Learning course (CS-433) from EPFL during the fall semester of 2021. Our team proposed a deep learning approach based on a double UNet accompanied with various innovative solutions. We managed to achieve a F1-score of __0.844__ and a precision of __0.916__.

## Repository description
- The dataset is available on the aicrowd.com page [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation/dataset_files).
- The bulk of our python functions are in the folder **source**. Detailed explanations are available inside it.
- `run.py` is the script to run in order to reproduce our model.

## Pre-trained model
The pre-trained model is too voluminous to be stored on GitHub. Instead, it is available here **INSERT LINK TO DRIVE**

## How to run the code 
**TODO**
